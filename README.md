# OOAD Final Project - ImpressiGAN
# Team Members: Zora Watters and Jake Andrus

*How to run:* Start a virtual environment with the modules contained in our requirements file, then run impressigan.py from the command line to start the app! </br>
*Language and Environment:* We used Python and Notebooks to import modules, then coverted to .py</br>
*About the Code:* Here we used 3 patterns: Factory to build models and handle IO stuff, Facade to hide the complexity of our system from the client (which is our CLI file), and I THINK template but correct me if im wrong jake
